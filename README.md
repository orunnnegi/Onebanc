# CSV Transaction Processor

This project processes CSV statements for financial transactions. It extracts debit and credit values, standardizes transaction details, and outputs the results in a new CSV file with a specific naming convention.
---
## Features

- **CSV Parsing:** Reads CSV files and converts them into a 2D matrix.
- **Column Extraction:** Identifies columns labeled "amount", "debit", and "credit" and extracts their values.
- **Data Validation:** Validates numeric values and handles special formats (e.g., amounts with "cr" indicating credit).
- **Transaction Processing:** Extracts transaction details including:
  - Transaction description
  - Date (stored in DD-MM-YYYY format)
  - Debit and credit amounts
  - Currency, transaction type, and card name
  - Location (stored in lowercase)
- **Output Naming Convention:** Automatically generates an output file name by replacing "Input" with "Output" in the input file name.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Accepts a CSV file name as pasted input.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** is required.
- (Optional) To use additional features like formatted table printing, install the `tabulate` package:
  ```sh
  python -m venv venv
  ```

Installation
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Ensure that all project files (main.py, transaction.py, and README.md) are in the same directory.

(Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
```sh
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
```

Usage
Running Interactively
Open a command prompt in the project directory.

Run the main script:

```sh
python main.py
When prompted, paste the input CSV file name including the .csv extension.
For example: HDFC-Input-Case1.csv
```
---

The program processes the file and generates an output CSV file. The output file name is automatically generated by replacing "Input" with "Output" in the input file name (e.g., HDFC-Output-Case1.csv).

How It Works

CSV Parsing

The CSV file is read into a 2D matrix where each cell is stripped of extra whitespace.

Debit and Credit Extraction (in transaction.py)
The module identifies columns labeled "amount", "debit", and "credit" and extracts their numeric values. It handles cases where amounts have "cr" (credit) notation.

Transaction Processing (in main.py)
The script scans rows for valid dates, transaction descriptions, and names.

Dates are parsed and reformatted to the DD-MM-YYYY format.

The location is stored in lowercase.

Additional transaction details such as card name, transaction type, and currency are extracted.

Output Generation
The processed transaction data is saved in a new CSV file using a naming convention where "Input" in the input file name is replaced with "Output".

Console Output
The program prints key information such as debit and credit values and the sizes of the respective arrays.

Example
For an input file named HDFC-Input-Case1.csv, the output file will be named HDFC-Output-Case1.csv. The output CSV includes the following columns:

Date (formatted as DD-MM-YYYY)

Transaction Description

Debit

Credit

Currency

CardName

Transaction

Location (in lowercase)

Troubleshooting
File Not Found
Make sure the CSV file exists in the correct directory or provide the full path when prompted.

CSV Format Issues
The CSV should have headers and a consistent format. The script expects columns for amount, debit, and credit to be present.

Invalid Data
Ensure that numeric values in the debit/credit columns are correctly formatted. Improperly formatted data may cause errors or lead to rows being skipped.
